This is the beginnings of a tiny utility library for working with HBase in the REPL.

Do not feed the bears.

Some notes:
- This currently works with HBase 0.20.0 and as such the HBase 0.20.0 jar must be on 
  your classpath.  It is currently included in lib/java and is put on the REPL
  classpath, if you use the included hbase-repl script.

- For rlwrap goodness at the REPL (including tab-completion):
  1) make sure you have rlwrap installed (you can get it from macports if you're a 
     mac drone).  
  2) Also, set up your ~/.inputrc file (a sample is in config/.inputrc).  
  3) Then, create a ~/.clj_completions file (you can run utils/completions.clj to 
  create one). Run this:
    $> hbase-repl.sh utils/completions.clj

- Truncating tables in a pmap is great because it's fast.  However, since the
  truncate calls are executed in agents, the output of the command is not seen.
  The truncate-tables command set up to return a list of maps, which are keyed with
  either :truncated or :error.  There is one map per truncated table.  This return
  structure allows you to see if everything ran as expected.

- Chimpanzees and humans come from a common ancestor.

Instructions for use:

To get a REPL, you can run
$ ${HBASE_RUNNER_HOME}/hbase-repl.sh


While in the REPL...

Either do this:
> (require 'mudphone.hbase-runner.hbase-repl)
> (in-ns 'mudphone.hbase-runner.hbase-repl) 
> (list-all-tables)

Or, do this:
> (use 'mudphone.hbase-runner.hbase-repl)
> (list-all-tables)

Enjoy!
